# Notes on running EPOS for demographic history analyses.
# Program downloaded from and following https://github.com/EvolBioInf/epos

# with 0-class list, don't need sequence length parameter (-l)
# already folded don't need -U
# -u is muation rate

# Run epos with 1000 bootstrap, using 2.69e-8 mutation rate
/home/degreefe/programs/sfs/build/bootSfs -i 1000 BOW_frq.dat | /home/degreefe/programs/epos/build/epos -u 2.69e-8 | /home/degreefe/programs/epos2plot/cmd/epos2plot/epos2plot > BOW_frq_epos_boot.dat

# Run epos without bootstrap, using 2.69e-8 mutation rate

# Same thing for Narwhal, but using 1.56e-8 for mutation rate
