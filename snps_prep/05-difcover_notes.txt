# Notes on DifCover, comparing coverage of male and female bam files to identify sex-linked regions

# Install DifCover
git clone https://github.com/timnat/DifCover

# Use "make" command in the "DifCover/dif_cover_scripts" folder and "chmod +x" for all the scripts in this folder

# Install DNAcopy package into R
R
library(BiocManager)
BiocManager::install("DNAcopy")

# Make sure bedtools, samtools, awk, and R (DNAcopy package) are in PATH

# Will need modal coverage for each bam file

# Copy and edit 'run_difcover.sh' script in working directory, then run script
# Example of parameters for one run; used 1/3 modal coverage for minimum, 3x modal coverage for maximum, and modal coverage sample2/ modal coverage sample1 as the AC value; the rest of parameters at default

a=5		# minimum coverage for sample1

B=48		# maximum coverage for sample2
v=1000		# target number of valid bases in the window
l=500		# minimum size of window to output
AC=1	# Adjustment Coefficient (set 1 if modal coverage is equal) 
p=2		# enrichment scores threshold (when p=2 will report regions with coverage in sample1 being roughly 4 times larger than coverage in sample2)
bin=1		# for auxiliary stage (5), generates enrichment scores histogram with scores in bins with floating precision 1. For more detailed histogram use 10, 100
